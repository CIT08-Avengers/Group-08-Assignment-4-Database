 *
 * Without it the three counts against a local database finish in about a
 * millisecond each, and starting them together costs more than it saves,
 * because the pool has to open two more connections. Waiting is what makes
 * the difference visible, and on a real server the waiting is real.

 * It should delete a student and then report whether they are still there.

 *
 * There is a second problem, worse than the wrong answer: if the delete
 * fails, who finds out?
 * Explain in a comment what happens and in which order,
and what happens to the error if the delete fails
 * Answer: We are not awaiting the result. Therefore await findstudent function happens fist. If deletion fails we dont find out because rejection is not handled.
